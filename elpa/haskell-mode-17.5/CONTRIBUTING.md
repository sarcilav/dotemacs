# Hacking on Haskell Mode

To try out your changes to Haskell Mode without affecting your global
Emacs installation, build Haskell Mode by running `make` here, and
then run

    emacs -L <path to this haskell-mode.git repo>

from any directory you'd like to test in. This makes Emacs load
Haskell Mode from this Git repo, instead of using any globally
installed version you might have.
