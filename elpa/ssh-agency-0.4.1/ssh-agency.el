;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functions to startup ssh-agent, prompt for
;; passphrases from the Windows console, and set the needed
;; environment variables in Emacs, so that pushes and pulls from magit
;; will not require entering any passphrase.
;;
;; It can also be useful on Unix-like platforms to delay having to
;; enter your passphrase until the first time you push to a remote.
